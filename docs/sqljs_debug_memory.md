# SQL.js WASM Debug Memory - Post Mortem

## Problem Description
WebAssembly compilation error in Kotlin Multiplatform web app deployed on GitHub Pages:
- Error: `CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): expected magic word 00 61 73 6d, found 3c 21 44 4f @+0`
- Root cause: `sqljs.worker.js` file contained incorrect path `locateFile:e=>"././sql-wasm.wasm"` (double `./`)
- The SQLDelight web worker was trying to load WASM from an invalid path, causing 404 errors

## Fix Description
Implemented robust webpack plugin with `normalizeSqlJsWasmPaths` function:
- Added `CopyWebpackPlugin` to copy all required SQL.js files (`sql-wasm.wasm`, `sql-wasm.js`, `sqljs.worker.js`)
- Created comprehensive regex patterns to fix various path formats:
  - `locateFile` arrow functions with any variable name
  - Relative paths (`../`, `./`, `//`) and absolute paths (`/`)
  - Both single and double quotes
- Applied normalization to both main compilation and distribution files
- All paths normalized to correct `./sql-wasm.wasm` format

## Result
✅ WebAssembly compilation error completely resolved  
✅ Note Delight web app fully functional on GitHub Pages  
✅ Database operations working correctly  
✅ All SQL.js components loading properly
